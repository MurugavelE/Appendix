# Appendix - Additional Topics and Tips

## About this chapter

The main aim of this book is to get you (the readers) acquainted with as much of Ionic as possible. So, I have followed an incremental approach from Chapter 1-9, from the basics of Cordova to building an app with AngularJS, Ionic, and Cordova. We were pretty much focused on learning Ionic with the bare minimums. In this appendix, we will explore a few more options of the Ionic CLI: Ionic.io, ionic-box and Sublime Text plugins.

**Note:** There is no code associated with this chapter.
